Hello there!
This is placeholder page for my Simple Radio Stations - package of simple scripts which can help with setting up your functional radio stations in your unity project.
This is just a ripof of one of my projects and it is not a big deal, but I would certainly be grateful for some of it years ago, because I was not able to find something like it while searching the internet.

BTW. You should get Text Mesh Pro to work with test scene
